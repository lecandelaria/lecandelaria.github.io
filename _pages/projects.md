[Robust Inference for Locally Misspecified Bipartite Networks](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/kc2vslq1q3q3b9p6gjgte/CandelariaZhang2023.pdf?rlkey=o0z7bkxec4tz8pd3m4zrfadmb&dl=0), with <a href="https://faculty.smu.edu.sg/profile/yichong-zhang-1521" target="_blank">Yichong Zhang</a>

Abstract:

<p dir="ltr" align="justify">This paper introduces a methodology for robust inference in bipartite networks under local misspecification. We focus on a class of dyadic network models with misspecified conditional moment restrictions. We consider a local misspecification framework in which the magnitude of misspecification vanishes as the sample size grows. We utilize this local asymptotic approach to construct a minimax optimal robust estimator that attains the shortest confidence interval length within a neighborhood of misspecification. Additionally, we introduce bias-aware confidence intervals that account for the effect of the local misspecification. These confidence intervals are asymptotically valid for the structural parameter of interest under sparse network asymptotics, both in the correctly-specified and locally-misspecified case. Monte Carlo experiments demonstrate that the robust estimator performs well in finite samples and sparse networks. As an empirical illustration,  we study the formation of a scientific collaboration network among economists.</p>


[A Semiparametric Network Formation Model with Unobserved Linear Heterogeneity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.05403)

Abstract:

<p dir="ltr" align="justify">This paper analyzes a semiparametric model of network formation in the presence of unobserved agent-specific heterogeneity. Its objective is to identify and estimate the preference parameters associated with homophily on observed attributes when the distribution of the unobserved factors is not parametrically specified. This paper offers two main contributions to the literature on network formation. First, it establishes a new point identification result for the vector of parameters that relies on the existence of a special regressor. Second, it introduces a simple two-step semiparametric estimator for the vector of parameters with a first-step kernel estimator. This estimator is consistent and has a limiting normal distribution as the number of individuals in the network increases. Finally, the paper applies this methodology to estimate the homophily parameters in a friendship network using the Add Health dataset.</p>
