I am an econometrician with a research interest in econometric theory and its empirical applications. Specifically, my expertise lies in social networks, panel data models, and data science. Currently, my research revolves around analyzing network formation models and spillovers.</p> 

I hold a PhD in Economics from [Duke University](https://econ.duke.edu/).
